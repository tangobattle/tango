//! Live PvP match orchestration.
//!
//! [`Match`] owns the connection-level state: shadow emulator, RNG, sender,
//! replay writer, round counter. It exposes `start_round` (creates a fresh
//! [`Round`]) and `run` (the network receive loop that feeds remote inputs
//! into the in-progress round).
//!
//! [`Round`] owns one round's worth of state: the local input queue, the
//! Fastforwarder instance that drives per-frame simulation, and the helpers
//! that wire remote-side prediction into FF.
