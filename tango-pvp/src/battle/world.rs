//! The mgba/Battle-Network adapter for the [`getgud`] rollback engine.
//!
//! getgud is plain rollback over an opaque state + input; everything
//! link-cable lives here. The opponent's per-tick packets aren't on the wire,
//! so [`MgbaSimulator`] derives them inside each step by co-simulating the
//! opponent (the [`Shadow`](crate::shadow::Shadow)) — for *both* confirmed
//! settles and speculative ticks, driven by the engine's predicted-then-confirmed
//! remote joyflags. Because the packet is always shadow-derived (never faked),
//! a speculation whose predicted joyflags matched the real ones is byte-exact
//! and the engine can promote it with no re-simulation; only a genuine
//! misprediction triggers a [`restore`]+re-step rollback of both cores.
//!
//! - [`MgbaWorld`] pins the engine's type axes: [`MgbaState`] (the primary +
//!   shadow snapshots and our in-flight outgoing packet) and [`PartialInput`]
//!   (joyflags).
//! - [`MgbaSimulator`] wraps the single [`Stepper`](crate::stepper::Stepper)
//!   core and owns the shadow.
//! - [`MgbaPredictor`] guesses the remote *joyflags* (held A/B); the packet then
//!   falls out of the shadow co-sim.
//!
//! The chosen display state is loaded into the live core — and the time-sync
//! skew turned into a frame-rate target via [`Throttler`](super::throttler::Throttler)
//! — by [`Round`](super::Round), not here.
//!
//! [`restore`]: crate::stepper::Stepper::restore
